<h1>30works30days</h1>
    <p>
        is a month-long project for makers where participants are required to submit a new piece of work daily for every day for the month of April. If they fail to submit something one day, they are out of the project. The project is open to everyone and any medium is encouraged. In 2020 over 1095 artists of all ages are participating from 42 countries around the world!!     </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.12ocollective.com/">12ø</a>  began 30/30 in 2015 to encourage making and experimentation. With the time restriction of one day you may find that the choices you make, the corners you cut, and those ideas that you couldn’t quite realise, are just as telling as the work that you produce.    </p>
    <p>
        You will be able to see everyone's works everyday throughout April on the live feed using the 30/30 icon (top left) and by following #30works30days. Each day a selection of the day's works are selected by different artists and displayed on our social media channels. For more information please go to the <a href="https://www.12ocollective.com/">12ø website</a> or email us at info@12ocollective.com​    </p>
    <p>
        We will be organising weekly hour-long critiques/workshops/conversations over <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. Different hosts will facilitate these sessions with the aim to give you a chance to check-in and talk to each other about the work you’re making. While these events will be available to all 30/30 participants, some sessions may have limited spaces. You’ll receive an email with an eventbrite link detailing the host and the event, so that you can book a place. Once we confirm your place, you will receive a link to the Zoom chat.    </p>

    <p>
        This year’s 30/30 has kindly been supported by <a href="https://www.artquest.org.uk/project/30works30days/">Artquest</a>.

    <u>I don't want anyone to see my work!</u>
    <br> You can tick the button at the bottom of the submission page to hide your work from the feed and the social media selection for that day. Only 12ø can see what you submit.
